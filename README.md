###How it works
The dispenser rotates each preset time, for testing puposes, theese are set to 2, 10, 18, 26 seconds. The clock resets at 32 secs. The switches on the side of the dispencer control which of the times a pill can be dispenced. When the dispencer rotates to a time corresponding to a switch in **ON** position, the LED will turn **green** and the button is activated. When the button is pressed a hatch opens and the pills falls into a shelf beneath. The shelf can be extracted.

###Details

Blue LED means the there are no current dose ready, but the system is waiting for the next serving time. The button is disabled.
LED off means all switches are in **OFF** position and the button is disabled.
